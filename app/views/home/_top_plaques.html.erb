<h2>Most-viewed plaques</h2>
<p>In the last 11 years, between 20 May 2009 to 6 Jan 2021, Open Plaques had 4,530,517 page views from 1,234,480 users.
Some were triggered by internet memes such as Steve Ullathorne's 2012 image of a George Orwell plaque with a CCTV camera next to it.
Others, such as those for Alan Turing, were probably triggered by an anniversary and campaign for recognition.</p>
