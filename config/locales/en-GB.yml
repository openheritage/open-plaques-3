      page_title: About Open Plaques
      featurette_1_heading: Open Plaques.
      featurette_1_subheading: The Museum of the Street est. 2009
      featurette_1_body: Open Plaques is a community-based project which catalogues, curates, and promotes commemorative plaques and historical markers (often blue and round) installed on buildings and landmarks throughout the world.   The service brings to life the history that plaques encapsulate - and to a larger audience - by building the definitive and most comprehensive resource about these historical markers. The data generated by the project are free to use under a Public Domain declaration. As well as showing where plaques are, we identify who is commemorated, when they were there, and what they were notable for. We uncover this data through a process of painstaking research by our team of volunteer co-curators (if you spot a mistake, [tell us](contact)).
      featurette_2_heading: What exactly is a plaque?
      featurette_2_subheading:
      featurette_2_body: Not all signs are plaques. A plaque is a sign that connects a person/animal/event/building to a specific location sometime in the past. It is a geotag in time as well as space. The purpose of collecting the plaques is to uncover the direct history of places. General plaques not denoting anything specific from history, and also memorial plaques (the kind you find in a church) to people or events that have no connection to the immediate vicinity fall outside our remit. Plaques erected primarily to denote the opening of buildings and businesses or awards given to buildings are also beyond the scope of the service, as are ones solely noting a burial site or grave. If you are unsure if a plaque meets the criteria of Open Plaques just email us and we will let you know.
      featurette_3_heading: You could get a new plaque put up
      featurette_3_subheading:
      featurette_3_body: We are the worldwide open register for plaques but do not create any ourselves (yet) but we know people who can make them for you. In the UK, anyone can erect a plaque as long as they have the building owner's permission, it isn't a listed building, and are prepared to pay for it to be made. Check your local area to see whether the local council or civic society has an active plaque program and approach them with your nomination. Alternatively, there may be a national society that might be interested. Or you can go it alone. Many people have. We have a short list of suppliers that we can recommend if you [contact](contact) us. If you do go ahead please say that we sent you as one day we might want to make one ourselves.
      featurette_4_heading: The data
      featurette_4_subheading: is used far and wide
      featurette_4_body: The data generated by the project are free to use under a Public Domain declaration. <br/>OpenPlaques data appears in [The Royal Society of Arts Heritage Index](https://www.thersa.org/projects/heritage/index), the Ordnance Survey points of interest database, and [Findery](https://findery.com). It has been used for a number of iPhone tourism apps as well as for treasure hunt games like Histonauts and the [Digital Traces and Physical Places Tweasure Hunt](http://connectedlimerick.wordpress.com/2012/04/23/digital-traces-physical-places/). Hackdays like The CultureCode Hack and [History Hackday](http://historyhackday.org/) held at the offices of The Guardian newspaper. The [AI Cookbook](http://blog.aicookbook.com/2010/08/automatic-plaque-transcription-pytesseract-average-error-down-to-33-4/) included an open challenge to produce Optical Character Reading of plaques.

You may have already used the web site for researching an article. We could help you to refine your search. We could provide some quotes. We might be able to find an unusual plaque to match your story.

      page_heading: How can you help?
      page_subhead: Open Plaques is a community-run website containing information about historical plaques found all around the world by people like you. We don't own it, we believe that our role is to curate it and then give the data back to the world for free. We are the museum of the street.
      action_1: Take a photo
      action_1_body: We display multiple photos of each plaque, so you do not have to be the first. We like close-ups and also long-shots of the building that set the scene. We deliberately do not ask you to upload photos to our site. We connect and add context to existing resources on the web instead of trying to own it all ourselves. The photos that we show are published with a Creative Commons licence on web sites such as Flickr, Wikimedia and Geograph. If you want to contribute your own photograph please click on the 'Your photo how to add it' link on the plaque page.
      action_2: Add a plaque
      action_2_body: Have you found a plaque in real life or on the internet that is not already in our database? Well, anyone can add to Open Plaques. If you don't have all the details tell us as much as you can and a plaque hunter will track it down....and no, it doesn't have to be blue. Individuals can add plaque listings and information directly to the site, and add photos to the listings via Flickr, Geograph, Wikimedia Commons, or by emailing them to us. Follow a "Your photo. How to add it" link on any plaque for more details.The service and the data are in constant development. If you know of any plaques not listed in our database (try searching the site first), we love to hear about them, or better still make your mark and add them to the website!
      action_3: Talk to us
      action_3_body: Things do not always work; there are many edge cases for whether a plaque should be included; you have something interesting to tell us; or the system is just too confusing. When in doubt, just contact us. One of our volunteers should be able to assist.
      featurette_1_heading: What is a plaque?
      featurette_1_subheading: the what, where, and when
      featurette_1_body: According to us, a plaque or historical marker is a sign that identifies something or someone that did something at or nearby the marked location at a point in time. For example "Winston Churchill went to school here in 1883" tells us what, where, and when something happened. We exclude foundation stones, grave markers, and memorials. There are always exceptions, so if in doubt send us an email and discuss it.
      featurette_2_heading: Does your organisation create plaques?
      featurette_2_subheading: Let's curate them together
      featurette_2_body: If you are from a civic society, council, history group, or any of the hundreds of organisations who have erected plaques please get in contact and we can add details of your plaques. We will accept a list in any form, just so long as it contains who the plaque is about and a postal address. Additional information like the full inscription and geolocation are ideal but not essential.
      featurette_3_heading: Use the data
      featurette_3_subheading: for a tourist app, a hackday, research, whatever
      featurette_3_body: We first created Open Plaques because we wanted some interesting linked geodata to play with but everything cost money. We want you to have some fun with it. The data we generate is Public Domain, so is free to use for whatever purpose you desire. We love it when people acknowledge Open Plaques and link back to us but you are under no obligation to do so.
      featurette_4_heading: Become a curator
      featurette_4_subheading: yyy
      featurette_4_body: Our band of curators have additional powers to curate Open Plaques' data. Generally they have added a number of plaques so understand the system a bit but now want to change some of their information. Apply to us by email.
